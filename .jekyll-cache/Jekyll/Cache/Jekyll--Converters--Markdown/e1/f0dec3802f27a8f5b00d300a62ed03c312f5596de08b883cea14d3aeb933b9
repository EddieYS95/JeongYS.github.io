<p>Iâ€™m Dilbert. Iâ€™ve been working as a Software Engineer for over 30 years. I like to innovate to solve challenging problems using technology. I work with a great Engineering team, but we have a good-for-nothing and clueless manager, who can be replaced with a monkey and the change would be for the better.</p>

<p>On a personal front, I live with two amazing pets - Dogbert and Ratbert, and three dinasours - Bob, Rex and Dawn - whoâ€™re hiding from the rest of the world. Iâ€™m single and have few friends due to my poor social skills, but I usually spend my time playing with computers and technology.</p>
